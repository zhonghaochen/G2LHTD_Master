## How to use it?
----------

This toolbox consists of two modules, i.e, extended morphological attribute profile (EMAP) and diverse-direction constrained energy minimization (D2CEM) detector. EMAP is run by **EMAP.m** in the ‘./EMAP’ folder, and its support functions are in the ‘./EMAP/supportFunc’ folder. D2CEM is run by **D2CEM.m** in the ‘./G2LHTD’ folder, and the **func_pear.m**, **func_calCorrMat.m** and **hyperSam.m** are used to support the calculation of D2CEM detector.
Here an example experiment is given by using **San Diego hyperspectral data**. Directly run **detect.m** in the ‘./G2LHTD’ folder with different parameter settings to produce the results. For more details, please refer to the paper.
